# Topic (i) - REWRITTEN GRAMMAR

In our revised grammar, we used the "%nonassoc" directive to eliminate ambiguities in the "if-else" production. We defined priorities and associativities using the "%left", "%right", and "%nonassoc" directives for operators, establishing the order of evaluation and associativity to the right or left.

We leveraged the "%right NOT" directive to assign the correct priority to the "+" and "-" operators when used as signs, ensuring a proper evaluation of expressions.

Added Priorities:

* %left COMMA
* %right ASSIGN

* %left OR
* %left AND

* %left BITWISEOR
* %left BITWISEXOR

* %left BITWISEAND
* %left NE EQ

* %left GT GE LT LE
* %left PLUS MINUS

* %left MUL DIV MOD
* %right NOT

* %left RPAR LPAR
* %nonassoc LOW

* %nonassoc ELSE

GRAMMAR

We restructured the original statement grammar into a simplified Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar to represent and enhance the understanding of syntactic rules. We included a specific node called "Statement Error" to eliminate potential ambiguities arising from error productions, ensuring proper handling of unexpected situations.

We introduced two distinct nodes - one named "ExprList" and another "ExprCall" - to address the need to incorporate the "Comma" node in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) only when dealing with an ExprLIST expression.

# Topic (ii) - Algorithms and AST Data Structures and Symbol Table

ASTree

This C code developed describes functions related to manipulating an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The `newNode` function is responsible for creating a new node in the AST by dynamically allocating memory for it and initializing its fields with a specific category and token. The `addChild` function adds a child node to a parent node in the AST, while `addChildren` adds all the children of a temporary node to a parent node.

The `get_parent` function determines the parent node of a specific node in the AST by performing a recursive search in the tree. Finally, `getchild` retrieves a pointer to a specific child of a node, numbered from 0, by traversing the list of children until the desired position is reached.

These functions are designed to facilitate the construction, modification, and navigation of an AST, providing an efficient approach for handling complex data structures commonly used in the syntactic analysis of programming languages.


Symbol Table

Unfortunately, we couldn't fully implement this goal due to a segmentation fault that caused a runtime error in Mooshak. However, due to our effort and the belief that, despite not scoring any points in goal 3 in Mooshak, our work was well-structured and had the necessary functionalities, we decided to include it in the final submission.
